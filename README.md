# IRobotics3 CS1301 Labs Fall 2024
## In my Intro to Computing Class I utilized an IRobotics3 Roomba model to program to complete various different takss within my labs. These ranged from, checking passwords through button input, to maze navigation and a delivery system. 
## I utilized a python library of robot commands and global variables to solve all of the different tasks using the Robot. I earned a perfect score one every lab and I am satisifed with my work.
### Every branch is a different lab with the different code files for each lab.
